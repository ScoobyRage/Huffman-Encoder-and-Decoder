# Huffman Coding Implementation

## Overview
This C++ program implements **Huffman Coding**, a lossless data compression algorithm. It compresses a string from an input file by assigning variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequencies and decompresses the encoded string back to its original form. The program manages text files for input, frequency data, compressed output, and decoded output.

## Features
- **File Creation**: Generates an `input.txt` file for users to provide the string to compress.
- **Encoding**: Reads a string from `input.txt`, constructs a Huffman tree based on character frequencies, generates Huffman codes, and saves the compressed binary string to `output.txt`. Character frequencies are stored in `frequency.txt`.
- **Decoding**: Reads the compressed string from `output.txt` and frequency data from `frequency.txt`, reconstructs the Huffman tree, and decodes the string, saving the result to `decoded.txt`.
- **Interactive Menu**: Offers a console-based menu to create the input file, encode, or decode.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- A text editor to modify `input.txt`
- Basic understanding of file I/O and Huffman Coding

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o huffman
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   ./huffman
   ```

3. **Follow the Menu Options**:
   - **Option 1**: Creates an empty `input.txt` file in the same directory as the program.
   - **Option 2**: Encodes the string from `input.txt`, saving the compressed string to `output.txt` and frequency data to `frequency.txt`.
   - **Option 3**: Decodes the compressed string from `output.txt` using frequency data from `frequency.txt` and saves the decoded string to `decoded.txt`.

4. **Provide Input**:
   - After selecting Option 1, open `input.txt` in a text editor and write the string to compress (e.g., "hello world").
   - Save and close `input.txt`, then return to the program to encode or decode.

## File Structure
- **`input.txt`**: User-provided file containing the string to compress.
- **`frequency.txt`**: Stores character frequencies (character and count pairs) used for encoding and decoding.
- **`output.txt`**: Contains the compressed binary string (e.g., "010101...").
- **`decoded.txt`**: Contains the decoded string after decompression.
- **`main.cpp`**: Source code implementing Huffman Coding.

## Example Workflow
1. Run the program and select **Option 1** to create `input.txt`.
2. Edit `input.txt` and add the string "hello".
3. Select **Option 2** to encode. The program generates:
   - `frequency.txt` (e.g., `h 1, e 1, l 2, o 1`)
   - `output.txt` (e.g., `01010110`)
4. Select **Option 3** to decode. The program generates:
   - `decoded.txt` (e.g., `hello`)

## Notes
- Ensure `input.txt` contains a valid string before encoding.
- The program assumes `output.txt` and `frequency.txt` are present and correctly formatted for decoding.
- A bubble sort is used for sorting nodes, which may be inefficient for large inputs. Consider optimizing with a priority queue for better performance.
- Memory management is handled via a `freeTree` function to prevent memory leaks.

## Limitations
- Supports characters within a limited ASCII range (0â€“99).
- Large input strings may produce long binary strings in `output.txt`.
- Minimal error handling for file operations or invalid inputs.

## Future Improvements
- Add robust error handling for missing or malformed files.
- Implement a priority queue for efficient Huffman tree construction.
- Support binary file output for compressed data to reduce storage size.
- Develop a user interface for easier interaction.
